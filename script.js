i don't know if this is right,
but i know that when im with u it feels so damn right.

im the type of guy that doesn't care about what other people think
but when im with u, i even count my eyes blink.
damn, ur just the girl i've always wanted
but i don't know if i still have it.

i want to love u unconditionally
but i still think of the probability.
that u're too scared to try,
that u have been scarred by life.

i get it, cause i've been there
but all that feeling vanished,
cause im always mesmerized
by ur smile, ur eyes, and ur laugh.
and hoping one day im the reason u do that
and when im with u i just wanna risk it all,
even when i fly or i fall.

i can't help myself when im beside u,
all my baggage just vanished when im talking to u.
u lessen my burdens in ways u won't understand,
i feel warm, fuzzy, and happy when i touch ur hand.
words are nothing, it can't really tell u how i feel,
but i can assure u my feelings are real.

im writing this tonight cause i miss u,
and i think im going insane.
i never felt this way before, but with u
"goddamn" that's all i can say.`,

but now i love it more being with you tonight;
every words you speak
feels like space —
a vast world where only
my heart finds it's place.

never thought it'd come to this,

i’ve loved people before, but never like this.
never with this mix of fear and certainty,
never with this quiet hope that maybe,
if the world was kinder,
you’d choose me without thinking twice.

i don’t ask for forever.
i don’t even ask for now.
i just want you to know that love —
the kind i feel for you—
doesn’t happen by accident.
it happens because something in you
felt like home,
the moment i got close enough to see you clearly.

when your heart stops trembling,
you’ll understand why i stayed.

your hand in mine —
mine in yours.

your hand is small —

it's quiet, warm, and steady —
like the universe finally answering a question
i didn’t even know i was asking.
funny how something so small,
can make you want to rewrite your whole life around a person.

my heart had been digging for.

you’re not a meteor —
you’re the sunlight that made the ferns grow back.
the warm earth after the storm.
the proof that even after extinctions,
something beautiful can still rise.

love is still simple.
it starts with safety —
with someone who stays
even when you can’t stay with yourself.

love lives in the small things:
the way you fix your hair without thinking,
the way you laugh too hard at my dumb jokes,
the way we learn each other’s habits
like muscle memory.

maybe we’ve been chasing the wrong picture —
thinking love should always be fireworks
when sometimes it’s just the quiet truth
that being with you
feels like breathing easier.

we fell so deep into the 
social media's definition of love —
that we forgot what love really asks for.
not perfection.
not constant happiness.

a little softness,

she was soft in the places
the world had tried to harden,
gentle in the moments
life taught her to be tough.

she was just a person —
messy, flawed, beautifully human —
and somehow that made her feel like home.

there was something sacred
in the way she lived quietly,
never asking to be adored,
never trying to be extraordinary,
just existing with a kind of honesty
that made the world around her soften too.

she didn’t know it,
but she was a place i want to return to.
a breath after the storm,
a calm in the middle of all my noise.
a solace —
the kind that doesn’t demand anything
yet gives everything
just by being there.

and maybe that’s the truth about real love:
it isn’t fireworks,
or destiny,
or perfection.

it’s seeing someone exactly as they are,
and choosing to stay —
not because they shine,

i didn’t understand it at first,

there’s a pull in them,
a gentle gravity
that makes me forget everything else
except the way she’s looking back.

they’re deeper than the ocean’s calm,
warm enough to steady my heartbeat,
and somehow they say
“you’re safe here”
without ever saying a word.

there’s a kind of romance in their silence —
no fireworks,
no noise,
just the quiet certainty
that i could look at them once,
look again,
and never want to turn away.

i think that’s why they stay with me.
because her eyes aren’t just something to admire —
they’re something to return to.

dancing, combing your hair,  
sitting quietly,

i realized i didn't like you

tell me the worries that sit heavy on your chest,
the mistakes you replay when the world goes quiet,
the things people misunderstood
that made you fold yourself smaller than you really are.

show me the cracks beneath your laughter,   
the tremble in your hands
when life gets loud,
the way you turn your face
when you're fighting tears you won't let fall.

i don't want the perfect version of you—
i want the honest one,
the one who feels deeply,
who gives too much,
who loves quietly but fiercely.

the girl who overthinks,
who hides her pain behind a smile,
who forgets her worth
because she's too busy carrying everyone else.

none of that scares me.
none of that pushes me away.

every flaw you fear
is just another place where your light slips through,
another part of you I want to understand,
slowly, patiently, gently.

you're not "too much,"
you're not "hard to handle,"
you're not "difficult to love."

you're human—
raw, brilliant, soft at the center
even when you pretend you're made of stone.

and if you ever choose to trust me
with the pieces you hide,
i'll hold them steady,
not to fix you,
but to learn you.

just one at a time.

just a single tulip,
quiet and sure in its own softness.

strange thing, really —
how one flower can change the meaning
of an entire field.

my heart does this little turn,
hoping—
just hoping—
for the shape of you.

an endless meadow of petals,
all bright, all flawless,

your love for tulips,

your soft spot for cinderella,
your obsession with buttered shrimp, fries,

the habits you’re scared will push someone away,
the fears that sit quietly in the corners of your heart.
i won’t look at you differently.
i’ll love you deeper for them.

i want to know the way your voice softens
when you admit you’re tired,
how your hands shake a little
when you feel overwhelmed,
how you pretend you’re fine
when your eyes are begging someone to notice you’re not.

let me see the parts of you
you’ve learned to hide —
not to fix them,
but to hold them
like something precious.

because every flaw you fear
is a place i want to rest my hands,
every crack you hide
is a doorway into something real and beautiful and you.

i don’t want the polished version,
the practiced smiles,
the brave face you show the world.
i want the girl who loves too much,
who feels too deeply,
who thinks she’s “hard to understand”
when she’s actually the easiest person in the world to love.

so tell me your flaws —
slowly, softly, one by one.
i’ll meet you where you are,
i’ll stay as long as you let me,
and i’ll love you not despite those pieces
but because they’re yours.

and if there’s anything you can’t say yet,
that’s okay.
i’ll wait.
loving you was never something

it's something i wanted to grow into

bleeding if i have to,

are worth knowing.

i wish i could tell her
how she makes my whole world slow down,
how her smile sticks with me
long after she’s gone,
how being beside her
feels like the closest thing to home
i’ve ever felt.

but for now,
i just admire her from where i am —
grateful i get to exist with her
under the same sun,
even if she’ll never be mine.`,

i miss her genuine laughter,
a laugh i never thought
that will be stuck in my head.

i miss her soothing voice,
it's as sweet as honey to my eardrums.
miss her random topics,
the way we laughed talking about it.

i miss her comforting smile,
it gives me peace i didn't know i wanted.
i seek it every day and night,
but i guess i can see it only on screen this time.

most of all i miss her eyes,
goddamn i can't put into words.
it pulls me in a world, into somewhere.
i don't even care where, 
but i know if i was given a chance —
i'll dive right in.

i can write up a whole damn essay 
just to talk about her eyes.
the way they look at me,
like they speak to me spiritually.

i'll trade the whole world —
if i can see those eyes every day
of my entire life.

i try to put it into words,
but it lives beyond letters and drama.

it's like a ray of sunshine
shining in my window at noon,
or the feeling of cold air 
filling my lungs.

i can't describe it well
but i know —
if her eyes can kill me,
i'll gladly face death.

i miss her,
in everything.
everywhere.
all the time.`,
